### HbnB Project - Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints

- This phase of the HBnB project focuses on implementing the application's core structure, including the Presentation and Business Logic layers using Python and Flask. 
- It involves developing key classes (User, Place, Review, Amenity) and setting up RESTful API endpoints with flask-restx to manage CRUD operations. While authentication and access control will be handled later, the emphasis is on creating a scalable, modular, and well-structured foundation for future enhancements. ðŸš€

our project is organized into the following structure:

Explanation:

- The app/ directory contains the core application code.
- The api/ subdirectory houses the API endpoints, organized by version (v1/).
- The models/ subdirectory contains the business logic classes (e.g., user.py, place.py).
- The services/ subdirectory is where the Facade pattern is implemented, managing the interaction between layers.
- The persistence/ subdirectory is where the in-memory repository is implemented. This will later be replaced by a database-backed solution using SQL Alchemy.
- run.py is the entry point for running the Flask application.
- config.py will be used for configuring environment variables and application settings.
- requirements.txt will list all the Python packages needed for the project.
- README.md will contain a brief overview of the project.
