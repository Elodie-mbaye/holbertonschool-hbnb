### HbnB Project - Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints

- This phase of the HBnB project focuses on implementing the application's core structure, including the Presentation and Business Logic layers using Python and Flask. 
- It involves developing key classes (User, Place, Review, Amenity) and setting up RESTful API endpoints with flask-restx to manage CRUD operations. While authentication and access control will be handled later, the emphasis is on creating a scalable, modular, and well-structured foundation for future enhancements. ðŸš€

our project is organized into the following structure:

Explanation:

- The app/ directory contains the core application code.
- The api/ subdirectory houses the API endpoints, organized by version (v1/).
- The models/ subdirectory contains the business logic classes (e.g., user.py, place.py).
- The services/ subdirectory is where the Facade pattern is implemented, managing the interaction between layers.
- The persistence/ subdirectory is where the in-memory repository is implemented. This will later be replaced by a database-backed solution using SQL Alchemy.
- run.py is the entry point for running the Flask application.
- config.py will be used for configuring environment variables and application settings.
- requirements.txt will list all the Python packages needed for the project.
- README.md will contain a brief overview of the project.

## Business Logic Layer

The Business Logic layer is responsible for implementing the core functionality of the application. It includes the following key entities:

- **User**: Represents a user of the application.
- **Place**: Represents a place listed by a user.
- **Review**: Represents a review of a place by a user.
- **Amenity**: Represents an amenity available at a place.

### Entities and Responsibilities

#### User
- **Attributes**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`
- **Methods**:
  - `create_user(name, email, password)`: Creates a new user.
  - `get_user_by_id(user_id)`: Retrieves a user by their ID.
  - `update_user(user_id, **kwargs)`: Updates user attributes.
  - `delete_user(user_id)`: Deletes a user.

#### Place
- **Attributes**: `id`, `name`, `description`, `user_id`
- **Methods**:
  - `create_place(name, description, user_id)`: Creates a new place.
  - `get_place_by_id(place_id)`: Retrieves a place by its ID.
  - `update_place(place_id, **kwargs)`: Updates place attributes.
  - `delete_place(place_id)`: Deletes a place.

#### Review
- **Attributes**: `id`, `text`, `user_id`, `place_id`
- **Methods**:
  - `create_review(text, user_id, place_id)`: Creates a new review.
  - `get_review_by_id(review_id)`: Retrieves a review by its ID.
  - `update_review(review_id, **kwargs)`: Updates review attributes.
  - `delete_review(review_id)`: Deletes a review.

#### Amenity
- **Attributes**: `id`, `name`
- **Methods**:
  - `create_amenity(name)`: Creates a new amenity.
  - `get_amenity_by_id(amenity_id)`: Retrieves an amenity by its ID.
  - `update_amenity(amenity_id, **kwargs)`: Updates amenity attributes.
  - `delete_amenity(amenity_id)`: Deletes an amenity.

### Examples

#### Creating a User
```python
from app.models.user import User

user = User.create_user(name="John Doe", email="john@example.com", password="securepassword")
print(user.id)  # Output: User ID
```

#### Creating a Place
```python
from app.models.place import Place

place = Place.create_place(name="Beach House", description="A lovely beach house.", user_id=user.id)
print(place.id)  # Output: Place ID
```

#### Creating a Review
```python
from app.models.review import Review

review = Review.create_review(text="Great place!", user_id=user.id, place_id=place.id)
print(review.id)  # Output: Review ID
```

#### Creating an Amenity
```python
from app.models.amenity import Amenity

amenity = Amenity.create_amenity(name="WiFi")
print(amenity.id)  # Output: Amenity ID
```
