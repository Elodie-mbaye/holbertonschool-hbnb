### HbnB Project 
This project focuses on implementing the Business Logic Layer and API Endpoints for the HBnB application using Flask and flask-restx, following a modular structure and the Facade pattern.
Key tasks include setting up the project structure, defining core business logic classes (User, Place, Review, Amenity), implementing CRUD API endpoints, and ensuring testing & validation using tools like cURL and Postman.
At this stage, authentication and persistence with SQLAlchemy are not yet implemented, but the system is designed for easy integration in the next phase.
