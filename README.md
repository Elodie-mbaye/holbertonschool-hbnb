The HBnB project in Holberton is a simplified full-stack clone of Airbnb, designed to cover backend development, database management, front-end integration, and deployment.

### ðŸ“˜ [Part 1: UML Diagrams](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1)
We launched the development of the HBnB Evolution application by creating a detailed blueprint. This technical document compiles all essential diagrams and explanations, serving as a comprehensive guide to the systemâ€™s architecture, design, and implementation phases detailing the steps from the user to the database.


1. [The high-level architecture of the application](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/00-architecture_diagram.md) with a package diagram that outlines the three layers and the use of the Facade Pattern.

2. [Detailed diagrams representing the business logic layer](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/01-class_diagram.md) with a detailed class diagram illustrating key entities and their relationships.

3. [Sequence diagrams for key API interactions](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/02-sequence_diagram.md) depicting critical operations such as :
    - [user registration](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/02-detailed_sequence_diagrams/2-user_registration.md)
    - [place creation](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/02-detailed_sequence_diagrams/2-place_creation.md)
    - [review submission](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/02-detailed_sequence_diagrams/2-review_submission.md)
    - [fetching places](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part1/02-detailed_sequence_diagrams/2-place_fetching.md)

### [Part 2](https://github.com/vlldnt/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/part2/hbnb)

This part is focused on creating a functional and scalable foundation for the application. You will be working on:

Business Logic Layer: Building the core models and logic that drive the application's functionality. This includes defining relationships, handling data validation, and managing interactions between different components.

Presentation Layer: Defining the services and API endpoints using Flask and flask-restx. You will structure the endpoints logically, ensuring clear paths and parameters for each operation.
