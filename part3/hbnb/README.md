# HbnB Project - Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints ðŸš€

- This phase of the HBnB project focuses on implementing the application's core structure, including the Presentation and Business Logic layers using Python and Flask.
- It involves developing key classes (User, Place, Review, Amenity) and setting up RESTful API endpoints with flask-restx to manage CRUD operations. While authentication and access control will be handled later, the emphasis is on creating a scalable, modular, and well-structured foundation for future enhancements.
